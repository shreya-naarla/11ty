<h2>The Siren Moon of Thalassa Prime</h2>
<h3>Date: Galactic Standard Cycle 4382.28<br>
    Location: Thalassa Prime, Outer Rim</h3>
<p>I had barely entered orbit around Thalassa Prime's largest moon when I heard it—a voice, threading through my comms system. At first, I dismissed it as radio interference, but then it spoke my name.<br><br>
    I activated every failsafe, ran a full diagnostic. No anomalies. No breaches. And yet, the voice continued, whispering, calling. Not a message, not an SOS—just music, haunting and familiar. It burrowed into my thoughts, unbidden.<br><br>
    I set foot on the moon's surface, a vast ocean frozen solid beneath me. My ship's lights cast long shadows over the ice, but I saw nothing. And yet... I felt something beneath the surface. Moving. Waiting.<br><br>
    Then I saw the impossible—my own reflection in the ice, staring back, but not as I am now. An older version of myself, weathered and weary. He—I—raised a hand as if to warn me.<br><br>
    The voice grew louder. My pulse spiked. Instinct screamed at me to leave. I didn't hesitate. As my ship lifted off, the voice fell silent. My reflection disappeared.<br><br>
    Some things are not meant to be understood. Some places should remain undisturbed.<br><br>
