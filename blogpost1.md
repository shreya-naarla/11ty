    Location: Xyphos-9, Uncharted System</h3>
<p>I have landed on a world lost to time. Xyphos-9, a planet orbiting a dying white dwarf, appears devoid of life, but the ruins tell a different story. Vast spires of obsidian-like material stretch toward the dim sun, their surfaces smooth, untouched by erosion. Whoever built this city—if it was a city—is long gone.<br><br>
    I wandered between structures, my boots crunching against fine, blue dust. No wind, no atmosphere to stir it. My suit's radiation shielding flickered momentarily, suggesting remnants of an artificial energy field. Scans indicate no biosignatures, but something about this place feels... watched.<br><br>
    Inside one of the towering edifices, I discovered what looks like an archive. Holographic projections flickered to life at my presence—glyphs and symbols dancing in the air, far beyond my comprehension. A deep, resonant hum filled the chamber, a sound I felt rather than heard. Some ancient mechanism responding to my intrusion?<br><br>
    I should leave soon. There are no threats here, no creatures or drones—but the silence itself feels unnatural, as though this place remembers. Perhaps I am the first visitor in millennia. Or perhaps the last.<br><br>
